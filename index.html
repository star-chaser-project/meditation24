            Life can be messy and tricky to navigate. While we can't always
            control the things that happen, we can change how we relate to
            life&apos;s ups and downs. It is difficult when most of our focus is
            stolen through an overload of information and digital chatter.
            That's where meditation can help to keep us in the present and less
            drawn into our thoughts or reactivity and more about being able to
            handle challenging times with self-awareness, understanding and a
            renewed sense of perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meditation gives us space - to breath - to be present and helps us
            make better choices to develop a little patience and learn be kinder
            to ourselves and to others around us.

          <!-- Content adapted from Baptiste 2002, pp 193-194 -->
          <p>The simplest way to meditate is to find a quiet space where you will not be disturbed for the length of time you have put aside, consider from 1 to 10 minutes.</p>
          <h3>Timing</h3>
          <p>If you are being guided, the person will indicate when the session begins and when the time is up by softly speaking to you or using chimes or a low sounding bell. If you are going solo, have a timer ready that is not too intrusive when that goes off or use one on your mobile phone.</p>
          <h3>Position &amp; other things to consider</h3>
          <p>Find a comfortable position that you can maintain for the time allocated. The most popular are:</p>
          
          <!-- tab panel for position info -->
           <!-- How section Tab panel from Shoelace -->
          <div class="tab-panel-size">
            <sl-tab-group class="tab-content" style="--indicator-color: #EF476F;">
              <sl-tab slot="nav" panel="tab-1" class="tab-colour">Seated on the floor</sl-tab>
              <sl-tab slot="nav" panel="tab-2" class="tab-colour">Seated in a chair</sl-tab>
              <sl-tab slot="nav" panel="tab-3" class="tab-colour">Laying down</sl-tab>
            
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-1">Sit on the floor on the edge of a firm cushion or pillow with legs comfortably crossed or extended out in front <br> or sit up against a wall.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-2">Sit in a chair with feet flat on the ground or place a cushion under your feet to support your back.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-3">Lay down on the floor on top of a towel or exercise mat (add a blanket over the top in the cooler months).</sl-tab-panel>
            </sl-tab-group>
          </div>

          <h3>Eyes</h3>
          <p>Your eyes can be closed, use an eye pillow, or leave open is ok too just let your focus be soft like gently gazing at a mundane spot like a wall or the ceiling.</p>
          <h3>Sensations</h3>
          <p>Begin being aware of the ground beneath you, notice what areas of the body are touching the floor, towel or mat, try to soften your feet, buttocks, legs, back etc.</p>
          <h3>Breath</h3>
          <p>Let your breath be natural, you do not need to force that or change the rhythm, all you need do is become aware of when you breath in and when you breath out, nothing more and nothing less than that.</p>
          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Let your thoughts pop into your head, and then let those go, do that again, and again and again…</p>
          <p>That&nbsp;s it!</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Types of meditation</h3>
          <p>There are many different types of meditations to explore:</p>
          
          <!-- How section tab panel from Shoelace-->
          <div class="tab-panel-size2">
            <sl-tab-group class="tab-content" style="--indicator-color: #EF476F;">

              <sl-tab slot="nav" panel="tab-5" class="tab-colour">Everyday things</sl-tab>
                    
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-1">There are meditations where someone guides you through a meditation
              or you can practice on your own. The one that best suits is different for everyone, some people
              may prefer to stick with one while others like a variety, the best part is you decide
              what feels right for you.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-2">There are many ways to work with your breath that can help create a calm 
              feeling and allow you to be present, because when you consciously think about your breath you are in 
              the now moment.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-3">Scanning the body is a great way to understand how much tension you may be 
              holding on to. When stressed, anxious or feeling pain, your muscle holds that as a memory, to release 
              while guided (or unguided) you can become more aware and learn that it is ok to release and reconnect 
              with your body.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-4">Most often a guided practice, involving a journey to a place or space of the 
              person&apos;s choosing, like their favourite place to unwind or feel calm, like the beach, or at the 
              top of a mountain.</sl-tab-panel>
              <sl-tab-panel name="tab-5">This takes many by surprise, but learning to do everyday things mindfully 
              with intent is a form of meditation, like eating slowly, eating and walking slowly.</sl-tab-panel>

            <p>Any time is good to meditate, whether that's in the morning, after exercise or before bed.

            <p>Start with a short time like a minute and work up to 10 or 15 minutes if and when you are ready.</p>
            <p>Sometimes meditating will feel easy and you'll wonder where the time went, other sessions will feel hard,
            really that is meditation, it is about being in the moment, letting things be and going with whatever comes up.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;How do I stay up right when seated?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The idea when sitting is to keep the back straight inline with your hips and to not hold onto your back muscles, 
              this can be easy for some and others will find the back aches, the more you regularly meditate the less you will tense up. Until that time, keep working with the sensations each session to discover what part of your back (top, middle, lower back, left side or right) or perhaps the hips (one side or both) you are holding on to and each time try to soften each spot more and more while each time trying to keep stay seated up right. The use of a wall can help with an addition of another pillow or cushion wedge behind the lower back to help if that area is prone to collapsing.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;I can&apos;t meditate, I fidget too much!</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Sensations and fidgeting and that overwhelming desire to move are normal and part of the practice and those will come up often when first starting to practice meditating or even whether you have been doing that for years. At first, you may find you can barely stay being quiet or still for long, but if you keep coming back to your mat or seated position and practice, you can work up to a time that works best for you. </p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;My mind wanders too much to meditate!</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>It is evitable as soon as we stop and try to be quiet and still, our minds wander, this is natural but even more so when we live in a time when our focus is constantly being stolen by technology and the desire to know what others are doing or saying. Meditation is allowing your thoughts to come up, all you need to realise is that meditation is not about, not thinking, as that is really hard to do, it is more about bringing space between your thoughts. Like a pause, that is where the reset can come in.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;I don&apos;t think meditating is for me</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Give yourself the time to get there and feel comfortable meditating and learn what works for you, there is so much information around that talks about the ideal amount of time to meditate, lets throw that idea out now, as it is a very individual thing!</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;I can't stop thinking!</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>This is the good part, let your thoughts come up, the idea is to allow those to pop into your head and then out of your mind again. When you realise your mind has wandered into a story, just notice that, then with intention let that thought go, you can reconsider that later, let this time be yours. You may need to do that again, again and again, that is meditation, letting your thoughts in and the letting them go. Sounds simple, but it can also be hard. Over time like anything in life that you have learnt that took time to grasp, to understand and discover that is what meditation teaches us that we can still grow, expand and discover stuff about ourselves and learning to be ok in our inner space, when you shift to that mindset that is it.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;But I don&apos;t have time to meditate?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Let's be real, please take the time to make yourself a priority. YOU are important. This is not about being selfish, but more about taking care of yourself and by doing that you may find you are better equipped to look out for others more without losing yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&nbsp;So how long is enough?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The best way is to begin slowly, with small timeslots whether once a day for a minute or two in the morning or before bed. You may find just once a day is enough like 1 minute or 10 in the morning is all you need, whichever works for you, there is no magic formula, it is totally up to you. Oh, and don&apos;t forget if you take a break for a day or over the weekend, that&apos;s ok too, there are no hard and fast rules, the magic happens when you find a regular timeslot that works for you, but go with what is ok for you.</p>
